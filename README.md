## Measurement Standards 0.0.1

This project standardizes measurement numbers across multiple measurement procedures. Due to changing standard numbers, this measurement guide was created to avoid downstream issues with CoRA and OsteoSort. These numbers will never change unless significant errors are identified. If a measurement becomes deprecated, the number will be indefinitely reserved. These standards provide a stable numbering platform on which advanced analytics can be built.
