## Measurement Standards 0.0.2

This project aims to standardize measurement numbers across various platforms. To prevent downstream issues with CoRA and OsteoSort caused by changing standard numbers, we have developed this measurement guide. These numbers will remain constant unless significant errors are found. If a measurement is deprecated, its number will be reserved. These standards ensure a stable numbering system, forming a reliable foundation for advanced analytics.
